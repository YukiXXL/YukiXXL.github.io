		<h1>INFORMATION</h1>
			<p>In this section, I will be only explaining what cheat codes do. The codes are available in .pnach files for use with PCSX2 Emulator.</p>
			<p>Cheat codes need to be renamed into (GAME_CRC).pnach. PCSX2 can read multiple .pnach files of the same CRC and with line added so you can have multiple .pnach's in the same game. To do it, simply add a line at the end (ex. CRC-something.pnach).</p>
			<a href="https://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-A-simplistic-guide-to-pnach-files-aka-pnach-for-dummies">Guide for using PNACH</a>
			<br>
			<p>If you need the cheat codes in RAW format, simply do these steps:</p>
			<p>1. Use "Find and Replace" to replace the lines "patch=1,EE," with "" (aka. NOTHING).</p>
			<p>2. Repeat for the lines "//".</p>
			<p>3. Replace the lines ",extended," with " " (aka. SPACEBAR).</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you want to convert the codes into format of your Cheat Device (Action Replay, Codebreaker, Gameshark, etc.), you will need the <a href="https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1980">Omniconvert app</a>.</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you wish to download the PNACH but it constantly opens as the text file, use the "Right Click > Save Link As ..." trick.</p>

			<h3>Play once for all objectives</h3>
			<p>Completes all objectives.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Ratings</h3>
			<p>Makes Headshots, Knife, Grenades, Non-Lethal, Kills ratings have 1312. Reason for making it 1312 is because the Kills Rating requiers big amount of kills and there is only one function in the game's code which loops and reads all 5. The game uses dynamic memory to write where those ratings are actually stored for the agent and this way the cheat code can be also used in modded ISOs.</p>
			<p>JAMPACK DEMO: Due to not having Dossier, the Ratings are temporary. Like "Open Levels".</p>

			<h3>All Solo Pars; All Team Pars; All Missions, No Collateral; All Missions, No Deaths</h3>
			<p>All par times are written with -10 seconds mark on lowest par (Carthage Mall). The reason for writting the same time is the same reason as for "Ratings".</p>

			<h2>Codes Explanation</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>DNAS Bypass</h3>
			<p>Bypasses DNAS check and let's you get online faster. RECOMMENDED!</p>
			<br>
			<h3>All missions online</h3>
			<p>Enables all missions for online mode (except Training).</p>
			<p>Alternative version of the code was kept for future references. Use it if the main one doesn't work.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/all_levels.png" alt="All Levels">
			<br>
			<h3>Lobby IDs fix</h3>
			<p>Every level (mission) has a Lobby ID. All missions that usually aren't online have Lobby ID -1. The game is only able to create a lobby with ID 9 or lower (since there are 9 online levels). This lines of codes changes the -1 IDs for the rest of the missions (except Training) to some that other levels use.</p>
			<p>This means when some game is hosted, it will also show up in other mission lobby. Example: if Italy is hosted, the game will also show up in Carthage Warehouse but you won't be able to join it.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Own agent on Bonus missions, Enable equiping weapons on Bonus missions</h3>
			<p>Usually you aren't allowed to have your own agent on Bonus Missions or equip your own weapons but this codes make it possible so that online could be more fun.</p>
			<p>If you skip the code, this is what you'll see for each agent idividually:</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/ALO/italy_online_reference.png" alt="Italy Online">
			<br>
			<h3>Bypass the OnlineIndextoLevel checking</h3>
			<p>The game checks twice if Lobby ID equals the Level ID that is written to be for online only. I don't know what's the reason for it but it only takes 2 lines of code for each check. All that now checks is if Level ID is equal to Level ID.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Training Mission enabled</h3>
			<p>Great. Now you also have the Training Center enabled.</p>
			<h3>Lobby ID fix</h3>
			<p>Fixes Lobby ID for the Training Center.</p>
			<h3>Bypass Level ID check</h3>
			<p>The game checks if selected Level ID is lower than 17 and Training ID is 23. If it fails, it doesn't allow to join the mission. Now it checks if it's lower than 24.</p>
			<h3>Training Level ID fix</h3>
			<p>The actual Training Center ID is 17. But the it's selection ID is 23. But it's also Level ID... I don't know how it works. Ask the developers. I am only here to make a check code that changes the ID from 23 to 17 once you press to join or create the mission so that it doesn't crash and so that you can see the games.</p>
			<p>Anyway, here are the IDs references (SP Lobby IDs are IDs for usually non-available online missions):</p>

			<br>
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>Launch any mission. When in the Equipment Modify, go to Sidearms, quit and re-launch the mission for changes to apply.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Codes Explanation</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Open weapons (NEEDED!)</h3>
			<p>Enables all weapons. This is needed in order to write the sidearm slot for all weapons. This includes enemies weapons so those can be also dual wielded.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/all_weapons.png" alt="All Weapons">
			<br>
			<h3>Back, Auxiliary weapons save as sidearm</h3>
			<p>Soon as you go to Sidearms, it saves sidearm slot for back and auxiliary weapons.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/DWM/sidearms.png" alt="All Weapons in Sidearm slot">
			<br>
			<h3>Back = Goggles</h3>
			<p>Since all Back weapons are in sidearm and instead of leaving the option empty, you can equip goggles instead.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/DWM/goggles.png" alt="Goggles in Back slot">
			<h3>Auxiliary = Flashlight</h3>
			<p>Same as above but for P.I.D in Auxiliary.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/DWM/pid.png" alt="PID in Auxiliary slot">
			<br>
			<h3>Animation change for all weapons</h3>
			<p>This changes holding animation so you hold weapons as dual sidearms.</p>
			<h3>Dual Wield Ability enabled</h3>
			<p>In case you don't have the dual wield ability unlocked. This enables it.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Show goggles and P.I.D in Equip</h3>
			<p>The Equip option doesn't usually show goggles and P.I.D but since you can equip/unequip them, now you can see if you have them equipped or not.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/DWM/equip.png" alt="Equip slot">
			<br>
			<h2>OLD CODES (ARCHIVED)</h2>
			<p>This codes were kept for future reference. Not used due to a bug of not being able to use P.I.D (Flashlight), Goggles, Grenades or Meele.</p>
			<h2>Dual Wield any weapon</h2>
			<h3>All weapons under sidearm (Equipment Modify)</h3>
			<p>Shows all weapons (equipment) in sidearms slot.</p>
			<h3>All weapons in sidearm weapon slot</h3>
			<p>Makes all weapons be in sidearm weapon slot.</p>

			<img src="../../img/SFOS/all_levels.png" alt="All Levels">
			<br>
			<h2>Codes Explanation</h2>
			<br>
			<h2>Menu codes</h2>
			<h3>Enable Online lobby in offline</h3>
			<p>When Online option is selected, drops to Command Center instead of trying to connect online. Also contains a code which throws the player back to Command Center after the mission is over, otherwise "disconnect" message appears and the player is dropped back to "Play Select" screen.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>OPTIONAL! All levels available in online mode</h3>
			<p>Enables all missions for online mode</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/all_levels.png" alt="All Levels">
			<br>
			<h3>Enable Mission Setup & Join Mission offline</h3>
			<p>Bypasses the check that checks if connection is established so that "Mission Setup" and "Join Mission" menus can open when offline.</p>
			<h3>Host Game fix</h3>
			<p>Bypasses the check that checks if connection is established so that the "Host Game" option in "Join Mission" screen works when offline.</p>
			<h3>Join any mission</h3>
			<p>Enables joining any mission (except for Training).</p>
			<h3>Join Training Center</h3>
			<p>Enables joining Training Center.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/offline/join_mission.png" alt="Join Mission screen">
			<br>
			<h3>OPTIONAL! Pick Region crash fix</h3>
			<p>When "Pick Region" option is selected, the game is looking for a file that contains the regions. Usually when it fails it drops and error on retrieving the regions. But in this case, it drops bunch of "TLB misses" in the emulator which crash on real hardware. This is optional if the player never chooses to use the option.</p>
			<h2>Begin Mission fix codes</h2>
			<h3>Write codename</h3>
			<p>When "Begin Mission" or SQUARE is pressed: Reads the "Number of agents" and writes the codename.</p>
			<h3>SuccessLobbyConnect</h3>
			<p>Jumps to "SuccessLobbyConnect" function so that the mission can start.</p>
			<h3>Somekind of error fix</h3>
			<p>When starting the game the second time, emulator reports "TLB misses" which crash the game on real hardware. This fixes it.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/offline/mission_setup.png" alt="Mission Setup screen">
			<br>
			<h3>Online, Offline enabler</h3>
			<p>Enables online-like experience. In details: it writes byte 0x01 into "FakeByte" adress instead of "m_bIsMultiplayer" which is used in later codes. Writing it into "m_bIsMultiplayer" would crash the game or make it unplayable.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Min num agents = 1</h3>
			<p>Makes minimum amount of selectable agents ONE. This is made so that codename "Cobra" can be selected.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Gameplay codes</h2>
			<h3>Enable online objectives + dialogues</h3>
			<p>Enables online (team) objectives like "Rescue all workers" in Krivorozhstal Mill and Stone speech about getting another agent in Belaya Vezha.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/offline/team_obj.png" alt="All workers objective">
			<br>
			<h3>Team Par</h3>
			<p>Writes Team Par.</p>
			<h3>Check if completed Par</h3>
			<p>Checks if Team Par is already completed and writes if the time is faster.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Checking Team objectives</h3>
			<p>Checks if Team objectives are also completed before writing a Team Par. Disabled by default since it would make it too hard to get Team Par solo.</p>

			<p>Writes Team Par if all objectives completed. If above code is disabled, it doesn't check the Team ones.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Buddy Climb</h3>
			<p>Enables Team interactions (Buddy Climb).</p>
			<h3>Animation Change</h3>
			<p>Changes the interact animation so that you don't wait for another agent and your agent just jumps.</p>

			<h3>Online controller</h3>
			<p>This controls EVERYTHING related to online mode.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Mission end fix</h3>
			<p>Fixes the infinite black screen after mission has ended. Not needed anymore but kept for future reference or when needed again.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Menu codes</h2>
			<h3>Equipment setup codes</h3>
			<h3>- Beginning at it</h3>
			<p>When the mission is loaded, it opens the Equipment Setup screen. This is needed to avoid crashes.</p>
			<h3>- After pressing square or triangle</h3>
			<p>When in Equipment Modify, after pressing SQUARE or TRIANGLE, it drops the player back into Equipment Setup.</p>

			<h2>Fixes codes</h2>
			<h3>Belarus 2 C4 stacks bug fix</h3>
			<p>On Belaya Vezha, when C4 stacks are reached, the player falls through the floor and constantly dies in the void even after respawning. A lot of "TLB misses" happen which crash on real hardware so this fixes the problem.</p>
			<h3>START button</h3>
			<p>Makes the START option act as in online. Used to avoid crashes.</p>
			<h3>START fix</h3>
			<p>It allows to start the mission without the countdown.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>OPTIONAL! USE ONLY IF "START fix" CODE ISN'T ENABLED!</h3>
			<h3>EQS CountDown codes</h3>
			<h3>- Fake Word for EQS</h3>
			<p>Usually when mission is being created, it goes through bunch of checks and finally writes a 4-byte word for the countdown. Since it is skipped using "SuccessLobbyConnect", this uses a fake value.</p>
			<h3>- Load the fake word</h3>
			<p>Loads the fake value that the previous code wrote.</p>
			<h3>Show timer instead of "WAITING FOR HOST"</h3>
			<p>Shows the countdown instead of "WAITING FOR HOST".</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/offline/eq_setup.png" alt="Equipment Setup">
			<br>
			<h2>PUBLIC BETA 1 EXCLUSIVE!</h2>
			<h3>EQS CountDown</h3>
			<p>Displays "WAITING FOR HOST". It is used alongside "START fix" due to problems with "EQS CountDown codes" which are listed here.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/offline/eq_setup_pb1.png" alt="Equipment Setup in Public Beta 1">
			<br>
			<h3>OPTIONAL! Show timer and count in Equipment Modify</h3>
			<p>Shows the countdown in Equipment Modify.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Quit fix</h3>
			<p>When the mission is over, the game crashes. This fixes it.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Gameplay codes</h2>
			<h3>Quickchat enabled</h3>
			<p>Enables Quickchat usage.</p>

			<h3>Minimap fix</h3>
			<p>Makes a proper codename appear when using minimap (LEFT D-PAD).</p>

			<h3>Codename spelling and dependecies</h3>
			<p>Needed for displaying the codename on minimap, statistics and for radio comms stuff.</p>

			<h3>Marks and Eff award</h3>

			<br>
			<h2>Codes Explanation</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>PAL video mode (gIsPALMode)</h3>
			<p>Enables PAL video mode.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>60 FPS</h3>
			<p>Makes the game run at 60 FPS.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Enable TEST button (LAN button (gLAN_AVAILABLE))</h3>
			<p>Enables the cut LAN mode button (called "TEST" after Jampack Demo).</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/test_button.png" alt="TEST button">
			<br>
			<h3>Awards 2 ratings/ranks on the back (Awards 3)</h3>
			<p>Makes customization items from Award 1/2 be also equipable on Awards 3 (Back).</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/awards_3.png" alt="Awards 1/2 on 3">
			<br>
			<h3>Auto-aim at legs (Jampack demo like)</h3>
			<p>Auto-aim to the legs. Cut feature from Jampack Demo. Headshot ability is needed!</p>
			<h3>Headshot ability always available</h3>
			<p>Enable Headshot ability for any agent.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/autoaim_legs.png" alt="Autoaim at legs">
			<br>
			<h2>CHEATS SECTION</h2>
			<h3>Plant infinite C4s on B2</h3>
			<p>On Belaya Vezha: After picking one C4 from the stacks, the agent is able to plant as much as it wants. Useful for blowing the bridge.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Write Par Time with minimum objectives completed</h3>
			<p>No matter how many objectives are completed, as long as mission is completed, the par time gets written (if faster than the previous one).</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Open weapons</h3>
			<p>Enables all weapons.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/all_weapons.png" alt="All Weapons">
			<br>
			<h3>Open Levels</h3>
			<p>Gives access to all levels.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/all_levels.png" alt="All Levels">
			<br>
			<h3>Invisible</h3>
			<p>You are invisible to any NPCs. Stealth cannot be broken this way and some rare dialogues can occur.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Levitation code</h3>
			<p>Press L3 to activate; R3 to deactivate. L3+/\ to go UP; L3+X to go DOWN.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>FUN SECTION</h2>
			<h3>Enable equiping P.I.D and Goggles</h3>
			<p>Enables equiping P.I.D and Goggles from Equipment menu in pause menu. WARNING! Changing weapons from P.I.D multiple times crashes the game!</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/equipped_pid.png" alt="PID Equipped">
			<br>
			<h3>Enable dropping Goggles</h3>
			<p>Enables Goggles to be dropped onto the floor.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/drop_goggles.png" alt="Dropping goggles">
			<br>
			<h3>Equip button shows goggles to equip</h3>
			<p>Equip slot shows Goggles as an equipable button. However, "Open Weapons" code is needed in order to see any goggles.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/equip_goggles.png" alt="Goggles under Equip slot">
			<h3>Show P.I.D instead</h3>
			<p>Shows P.I.D (Flashlight) instead. In case the "Open Weapons" code is unused.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/equip_pid.png" alt="PID under Equip slot">
			<br>
			<h3>Enemies aim faster: Hard; Very Hard; Ultra Hard</h3>
			<p>As the name suggests, it makes the game harder as NPCs aim faster which include both friendly and non-friendly. It also applies to agent's auto-aim.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>No Range</h3>
			<p>Makes auto-aim have no range which makes freindly and non-freindly NPCs not being able to shoot.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Own agent on Bonus missions</h3>
			<p>Have your own agent on Bonus missions. Alternative version of the code was kept for future reference and can be used if the current one doesn't work.</p>
			<h3>Enable equiping weapons on Bonus missions</h3>
			<p>Equip weapons on Bonus missions. Alternative version of the code was kept for future reference and can be used if the current one doesn't work.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/agent_equip_bonus.png" alt="Own agent and equipping weapons on Chechnya">
			<br>
			<h3>Disable forcing weapons on Kyrgzstan and Chechnya</h3>
			<p>Since the weapons are forced om Kyrgzstan and Chechnya Bonus missions, this code bypasses that forcing and makes it possible to use other weapons. However, Code that enables equiping weapons on Bonus Missions is needed!</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/disable_forced_weapons.png" alt="Disabled forced weapons on Kyrgzstan">
			<br>
			<h3>Enable all spawns</h3>
			<p>Not having enough enemies on your screen? Well now you do. And this also changes things around objectives and such. It's like an alternative gameplay. I would hardly recommend to use the code below with it!</p>
			<h3>Memory fix</h3>
			<p>Due checkpoints being messed up and not being able to respawn, and some enemies not appearing on the radar and not being able to be killed, it needed to be fixed so this code was made.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/all_spawns.png" alt="All spawns on Lorelei">
			<br>
			<h3>Spawn on different location instead of enemy/friend</h3>
			<p>Another code that alters the gameplay. Your spawnpoint replaces with spawnpoint of one of the enemies or the friendly NPCs (like Lian in Myanamr).</p>
			<h3>Bonus missions</h3>
			<p>To make it work on Bonus missions.</p>
			<h3>Fix for crashes</h3>
			<p>I would recommend using this since the enemies/freinds that got replaced won't be spawning back and triggering their spawnpoint makes the game crash. This code enables "Online controller" only. However, this still cannot fix for some missions where it crashes on real hardware so emulator should be used which ignores some of the "TLB misses".</p>
			<p>Currently, I know that "TLB Misses" happen before the mission loads on: Kyrgzstan, Chechnya and Montenegro.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/diff_location_spawn.png" alt="Replaced one of the hostages on Chechnya">
			<br>
			<h3>Everyone invisible</h3>
			<p>Makes everyone invisible. Even you.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/everyone_invisible.png" alt="Everyone invisible on Krivorozhstal Mill">
			<br>
			<h3>Disable radio logs</h3>
			<p>This was made so that "The first part of the mission is complete" can be heard on some missions where there are other lines. It disables the mission-only dialogues.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Count kill as Collateral</h3>
			<p>If you wonder why was this created... well, it's so that the voice lines for killing collateral targets can be heard for Meggie in Minsk or for Lian in Tokyo/Myanmar.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Toss Body instead of laying it down</h3>
			<p>Tosses body like in earlier prototypes. The animation files stayed intact and there is some code that uses it but is never used in vanilla game so a code had to be made that would replace the animation. This also works for online and other players will see you tossing the body instead of laying it down.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/tossing_body.gif" alt="Toss Body animation">
			<br>
			<h3>Random outfits during missions</h3>
			<p>You get a different outfit in different mission. It's not really random but I don't know how are outfits choosen. This also applies to codenames so the agent will have different outfit by different codename.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/different_outfits.png" alt="Different outfits on Training Center">
			<br>
			<h3>Disable mission disguises</h3>
			<p>Disables special disguises on Belaya Vezha, Arms Bazaar, Taherir Palace and Minsk.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Change comms voice</h3>
			<p>Change the voice behind the agents communication system.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Change weather on missions that support it</h3>
			<p>Make it snow on Tokyo or Lorelei. Or make it rain on Belaya Vezha. Minsk uses some special fog which cannot be changed. Carthage Mall and Myanmar uses a fog which is removed if something else is used instead.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/lorelei_snowing.png" alt="Snowing on Lorelei">
			<br>
			<h2>EXPERIMENTAL SECTION</h2>
			<h3>num_agnets (1-8)</h3>
			<p>Make minimum number of agents ONE and maximum EIGHT.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>ONLINE SECTION</h2>
			<h3>Start with only one player</h3>
			<p>Enables starting the game with only one player.</p>
			<h3>Be other codename and have button working</h3>
			<p>If wanting to be another codename and still start the game with only one player. The codename would have to be forced by changing "n_mClientIndex" adress. Game is softlocked since it only sees the "client" and not the "host". Using this online is NOT recommended as the game cannot be started by the actual host.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>PUBLIC BETA 1 EXCLUSIVE!</h2>
			<h3>gENABLE_DNAS_CHECK</h3>
			<p>Makes that adress be ZERO so that the game doesn't check the DNAS.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>gCHEATS_ENABLED</h3>
			<p>Cheat menu is opened with tilde key on the keyboard.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Cheat codes:</p>

			<p>* - ???</p>
			<p>WIN - Completes the selected mission with -1 second from both Solo and Par time, with ZERO collateral and deaths, with all objectives completed.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/prototype/pb1_cheat.png" alt="Cheat menu">
			<br>
			<h3>debugInfoFlag</h3>
			<p>Shows debug flag info in the bottom-right corner.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/prototype/pb1_flag.png" alt="Debug info flag">
			<br>
			<h3>debugTest</h3>
			<p>I don't know what this one does.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>MENU SECTION</h3>
			<h3>LevelValid</h3>
			<p>Selectes which level are valid (available). By default, only those which are playable as they have files are valid but this code makes all levels valid. Used in special modded ISO for Public Beta 1 with all level files presented.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>CHEATS SECTION</h3>
			<h3>Don't receive damage</h3>
			<p>As the name suggests, agent won't receive any damage from any weapon or fire or fall.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>NOVEMBER DEMO EXCLUSIVE!</h2>
			<p>November Demo doesn't require a code but needs only USB keyboard and special in-game console can be opened with tilde key.</p>
			<p>Cheat codes:</p>
			<p>OFF - ???</p>
			<p>INVUL - Enables invulnerability (can be toggled by typing OFF/ON in-game like "cheat invul off" to turn off).</p>
			<p>LEVEL - I don't know what this one does.</p>
			<p>COMPLETE - this one is better used in the Command Center. Completes all objectives.</p>
			<p>* - ???</p>
			<p>WIN - Completes the mission with par time and no deaths/collateral.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/prototype/pb1_cheat.png" alt="Cheat menu">

			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/prototype/jd_menu.png" alt="Jampack Demo menu items">
			<br>
			<h3>New Agent Changes</h3>
			<p>Since there are cut customization items and Agent Modify doesn't work, I made this code which changes things in New Agent screen. Simply change the game type in Mission Setup screen and return to the Agent creation screen.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/prototype/jd_missionsetup.png" alt="Jampack Demo Mission Setup screen">
			<p>Changing the game type to Single:</p>
