		<h1>General</h1>
			<h2 id="epdd">E.P.D.D. Acronym</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>The Taser in The Omega Strain and in later Syphon Filter installments is called E.P.D.D. and it’s not stated anywhere what it actually stands for.</p>
				<p>However, the shorter-range Taser, the E.D.T stands for “Electro-muscular Disruption Technology”.</p>
				<p>So, our best guess is that E.P.D.D. stands for “Electro-muscular Pulse Disruption Device”.</p>
				<p>Also the E.D.T description mentions its range being 25 feet while it doesn’t mention the range of the E.P.D.D, but later in Dark Mirror and Logan’s Shadow they used the same description for both the E.D.T. and the E.P.D.D and they added that the E.P.D.D.’s range is 200 feet.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="username">Change the agents name</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>On the online login screen, chaning the username also changes the offline agent name.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="ammo_share">Ammunition Share</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>Certain weapons use the same ammo type. By knowing which ones uses which, the ammo can be shared between weapons.</p>
				<p>For example, the M16-k shares ammo with Mark 23 so Mark 23 can be equipped just for extra ammo for M16-k.</p>
				<p>A less known combination is ACR that shares ammo for Air Pistol. This makes getting non-lethal ranks easier.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="smokes">Smoke Grenades trick</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>A simple trick that will help with avoiding fire while carrying a body.</p>
				<h3>How to do it?</h3>
				<p>When carrying a body, pause the game and open the Equipment menu. From there, use L2/R2 to select the Smoke greandes and press X to equip them. Unpause the game and simply use SQUARE to drop them.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="dormagen">Dormagen Grenades trick</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>This is useful trick for getting ZERO deaths on any mission.</p>
				<h3>How to do it?</h3>
				<p>Equip Dormagen grenades and when low on flak jacket or health, drop one close to your agent. Agent gets knocked out and respawns with full flak jacket and health.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="sarin_tricks">Sarin Grenade tricks</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>Useful tricks when using Sarin grenades. The sarin gas expands and works through floors and walls.</p>
				<h3>How to do it?</h3>
				<p>Drop the sarin close to a wall where the enemy is. For example, in Warehouse District, drop the sarin into the corner of the furnace room. The gas spreads through ceilling/wall where the ALA usually spawns. Before the gas dissapears, climb the ladder to spawn them and they will instantly die.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="bonus_trick">Bonus Missions: Flak Jackets trick</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>This one is useful for Montenegro mission.</p>
				<h3>How to do it?</h3>
				<p>Simply reset the mission. The easiest thing to do is to die and wait for the mission to reset. Once it is done, enemies won't have flak jackets. This works for any Bonus mission.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="jump_glitch">Jump Glitch</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>The oldest glitch in the book and the most sexiest one. The original name of this glitch was "5 out of 10 glitch" because it would happen 5 times out of 10. Thank God the developers didn't patch this as this is the best glitch in the game that everyone likes to use.</p>
				<h3>How to do it?</h3>
				<p>Use CIRCLE to roll and once the agent is in animation of getting up from the back, spam X.</p>
				<p>For more info, check the video made by TOS Elder himself, the MattyBoy:</p>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SErp1F6ESY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<br>
				<p>To perform a higher jump, equip back weapon and turn on the flashlight. Also, jumping sideways using L2/R2 is also higher.</p>
				<p>The terrain makes a difference, so if you keep trying and can’t jump then change the jumping spot on the ground. Upward ground slopes give you an advantage.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This glitch can be used for bunch of Team objectives like: Laptop on Quarantine Zone, Scud missile on Taherir Palace, Flight box recorder on Myanmar and stopping the missile on Ukraine which is one of the hardest.</p>
				<p>Here is a proof for stopping the missile on Ukraine using Jump Glitch by Pandutney. NOTE: This only works on original hardware and not the emulator!</p>

				<p>It can be also used for Blowing the bridge on Belaya Vezha but it is barely possible. Here is a proof guide by Pandutney on how to do it:</p>

			<h2 id="magic_box">Magic Box glitch</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>Get any weapon you desire without cheat codes.</p>
				<h3>How to do it?</h3>
				<p>In summary, go to Warehouse District for easiest method.</p>
				<p>Step 1: Equip FA-MAS and clear the area to the right where train cart is with the C4. Make sure not to use the FA-MAS as you'll need it with full magazine.</p>
				<p>Step 2: Locate the box which contains another FA-MAS. It is on top of the small staircase.</p>
				<p>Step 3: Fire 5 rounds of equipped FA-MAS and then place it in the box. Step away for a bit and open the box and take whatever is in there.</p>
				<p>Step 4: Drop the equipped weapon to the ground and pick up another one from the box. Repeat this until you can have 200 rounds in that NULL weapon.</p>
				<p>Step 5: Once you have a NULL back weapon with 200 magazine, drop it to the floor somewhere safe and place other "0/0" ones into the box.</p>
				<p>Step 6: Pickup the dropped 200 magazine back weapon and start shooting until you reach the desired weapon to replace.</p>
				<p>Step 7: Once reached, drop the weapon into the box, step away and the re-open the box and take the desired weapon.</p>

			<h2 id="bonus_glitch">Cobra glitch</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>Play as your own agent and equip weapons on Bonus missions without cheat codes.</p>
				<h3>How to do it?</h3>
				<p>When in Command Center, select the mission which is the closest to Bonus mission and have the dialogue "Play Mission" opened and selected. Right after miliseconds of selecting "Play Mission", switch to the Bonus mission. If done correctly, you should have your own agent on Bonus mission and can equip weapons.</p>
				<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/agent_equip_bonus.png" alt="Own agent and equipping weapons on Chechnya">
				<br>
				<p>Doing this reversed, from Bonus mission to normal one will default looking Cobra (PC_MALE.SKL) which is also the Cobra in the Demo.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Explanation?</h3>
				<p>Before loading the mission, the game first loads "UseLevelCharacter" and "UseLevelWeapons" adresses which tell whatever to use the specific level character and specific weapons. Then right after it starts the mission.</p>
				<br>
			<h2 id="flamer">Flamethrower glitch</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>A glitch that makes NPCs invincible. Useful for getting the grenade ratings or for Zohar on Taherir Palace so that he cannot be killed.</p>
				<h3>Grenade ratings glitch</h3>
				<p>Sarin is needed and if doing without cheat codes, it can be done on Ukraine only.</p>
				<p>Step 1: Take out the first officer from the very start and get his sarin grenades. There is one more sarin in the box in the closes tent.</p>
				<p>Step 2: Get to Gabe by either taking out the rest of the officers or letting Leonov escape. Eitherway, make sure to have at least 2 sarin grenades.</p>
				<p>Step 3: When close to silo, there should be flamethrower guys spawning. Take them out and collect their weapon before their body boxes disappear.</p>
				<p>Step 4: When in silo, the Gabe will hack the missile. While he is doing that, try to find some enemy which you can auto-lock onto.</p>
				<p>Step 5: Now the actual flamethrower glitch. To make it, you need to find a certain point where auto-lock turns from green to red while moving away/closer the enemy.</p>
				<p>Step 6: Once the point has been found, single burst with the flamethrower (press SQUARE, you may hold it for couple if miliseconds) while moving away from the enemy and in the point found from Step 5.</p>
				<p>Step 7: If enemy dies, repeat Step 5 and 6. If enemy catched fire but is not dying, all you have to do now is drop Sarin grenade onto him. You will hear constant death sounds but the enemy won't be killed.</p>
				<p>After 2 Sarin grenades, the amount of grenade kills should be 500 or more.</p>
				<h3>Invincible Zohar glitch</h3>
				<p>For this one, the "Open Weapons" cheat code is needed to equip the flamethrower.</p>
				<p>This glitch sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It can work for online but is hard to get it working due to latency.</p>
				<p>With flamethrower equipped, get to Zohar and kill enemies so he can move. Once he is about to run across the wall which is above his spawn point, manually aim with the flamethrower to his path. Your aim should be alligned with the palm. While Zohar is crossing, hold the FIRE button so he can catch fire.</p>
