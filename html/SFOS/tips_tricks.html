			<h2 id="jump_glitch">Jump Glitch</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>The oldest glitch in the book and the most sexiest one. The original name of this glitch was "5 out of 10 glitch" because it would happen 5 times out of 10. Thank God the developers didn't patch this as this is the best glitch in the game that everyone likes to use.</p>
				<h3>How to?</h3>
				<p>Use CIRCLE to roll and once the agent is in animation of getting up from the back, spam X.</p>
				<p>For more info, check the video made by TOS Elder himself, the MattyBoy:</p>

				<br>
				<p>To perform a higher jump, equip back weapon and turn on the flashlight. Also, jumping sideways using L2/R2 is also higher.</p>
				<p>The terrain makes a difference, so if you keep trying and canâ€™t jump then change the jumping spot on the ground. Upward ground slopes give you an advantage.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This glitch can be used for bunch of Team objectives like: Laptop on Quarantine Zone, Scud missile on Taherir Palace, Flight box recorder on Myanmar and stopping the missile on Ukraine which is one of the hardest.</p>
				<p>Here is a proof for stopping the missile on Ukraine using Jump Glitch by Pandutney. NOTE: This only works on original hardware and not the emulator!</p>

				<p>It can be also used for Blowing the bridge on Belaya Vezha but it is barely possible. Here is a proof guide by Pandutney on how to do it:</p>

				<p>Step 2: Locate the box which contains another FA-MAS. It is on top of the small staircase.</p>
				<p>Step 3: Fire 5 rounds of equipped FA-MAS and then place it in the box. Step away for a bit and open the box and take whatever is in there.</p>
				<p>Step 4: Drop the equipped weapon to the ground and pick up another one from the box. Repeat this until you can have 200 rounds in that NULL weapon.</p>
				<p>Step 5: Once you have a NULL back weapon with 200 magazine, drop it to the floor somewhere safe and place other "0/0" ones into the box.</p>
				<p>Step 6: Pickup the dropped 200 magazine back weapon and start shooting until you reach the desired weapon to replace.</p>
				<p>Step 7: Once reached, drop the weapon into the box, step away and the re-open the box and take the desired weapon.</p>

				<img src="../../img/SFOS/misc/agent_equip_bonus.png" alt="Own agent and equipping weapons on Chechnya">

				<br>

				<br>
			<h2 id="flamer">Flamethrower glitch</h2>
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>A glitch that makes NPCs invincible. Useful for getting the grenade ratings or for Zohar on Taherir Palace so that he cannot be killed.</p>
				<h3>Grenade ratings glitch</h3>
				<p>Sarin is needed and if doing without cheat codes, it can be done on Ukraine only.</p>
				<p>Step 1: Take out the first officer from the very start and get his sarin grenades. There is one more sarin in the box in the closes tent.</p>
				<p>Step 2: Get to Gabe by either taking out the rest of the officers or letting Leonov escape. Eitherway, make sure to have at least 2 sarin grenades.</p>
				<p>Step 3: When close to silo, there should be flamethrower guys spawning. Take them out and collect their weapon before their body boxes disappear.</p>
				<p>Step 4: When in silo, the Gabe will hack the missile. While he is doing that, try to find some enemy which you can auto-lock onto.</p>
				<p>Step 5: Now the actual flamethrower glitch. To make it, you need to find a certain point where auto-lock turns from green to red while moving away/closer the enemy.</p>
				<p>Step 6: Once the point has been found, single burst with the flamethrower (press SQUARE, you may hold it for couple if miliseconds) while moving away from the enemy and in the point found from Step 5.</p>
				<p>Step 7: If enemy dies, repeat Step 5 and 6. If enemy catched fire but is not dying, all you have to do now is drop Sarin grenade onto him. You will hear constant death sounds but the enemy won't be killed.</p>
				<p>After 2 Sarin grenades, the ammount of grenade kills should be 500 or more.</p>
				<h3>Invincible Zohar glitch</h3>
				<p>For this one, the "Open Weapons" cheat code is needed to equip the flamethrower.</p>
				<p>This glitch sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It can work for online but is hard to get it working due to latency.</p>
				<p>With flamethrower equipped, get to Zohar and kill enemies so he can move. Once he is about to run across the wall which is above his spawn point, manually aim with the flamethrower to his path. Your aim should be alligned with the palm. While Zohar is crossing, hold the FIRE button so he can catch fire.</p>
