			<h2>Codes listed here are not 100 % tested and not all codes listed here are available/ported in other PNACH's due to lack of time.</h2>

		<h1>INFORMATION</h1>
			<p>The codes are available in .pnach files for use with PCSX2 Emulator.</p>
			<p>Cheat codes need to be renamed into (GAME_CRC).pnach. PCSX2 can read multiple .pnach files of the same CRC and with line added so you can have multiple .pnach's in the same game. To do it, simply add a line at the end (ex. CRC-something.pnach).</p>
			<a href="https://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-A-simplistic-guide-to-pnach-files-aka-pnach-for-dummies">Guide for using PNACH</a>
			<br>
			<p>If you need the cheat codes in RAW format, simply do these steps:</p>
			<p>1. Use "Find and Replace" to replace the lines "patch=1,EE," with "" (aka. NOTHING).</p>
			<p>2. Repeat for the lines "//".</p>
			<p>3. Replace the lines ",extended," with " " (aka. SPACEBAR).</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you want to convert the codes into format of your Cheat Device (Action Replay, Codebreaker, Gameshark, etc.), you will need the <a href="https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1980">Omniconvert app</a>.</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you wish to download the PNACH but it constantly opens as the text file, use the "Right Click > Save Link As ..." trick.</p>

		<h1>Addons / Improvements</h1>
		<h2>Codes that improve gameplay experience.</h2>
			<h4>480p</h4>
			<p>Forces 480p Progressive Scan.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>60 FPS (by asasega; ported for PAL-E by YukiXXL)</h4>
			<p>Makes the game run at 60 FPS.</p>
			<p>Alternative version of the code was kept for future reference and can be used if the current one doesn't work.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Enable single Deagle/Uzi</h4>
			<p>Enables switching between single or dual Deagles or Uzis.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/single_uzi.png" alt="Single Uzi">
			<br>
			<h4>Multiplayer model in Single Player</h4>
			<p>Makes multiplayer model appear in Single Player.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/mp_model_in_sp.png" alt="Multiplayer model in Single Player">
			<br>
			<h4>Get Medals on Easy Difficulty</h4>
			<p>Enable getting medals on Easy difficulty. It's even harder to get Gold than on Normal.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Don't restart from a Checkpoint in SP (like in COOP)</h4>
			<p>Don't go back to the checkpoint and just respawn and continue instead.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Prevent teleporting players in COOP</h4>
			<p>Like the title sas, the players won't be auto-teleported but this can make other player stuck.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Texture quality on all gamemodes</h4>
			<p>Enable the desired texture quality. The sharp ones which are used in SP may produce lags in COOP.</p>
			<p>1 = Textures are blurred (COOP)</p>
			<p>0 = Textures are sharp (SP)</p>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/diff/texture_quality.png" alt="Texture Quality Differences">
			<br>
			<h4>Fake Byte. Used for stuff below. \/</h4>
			<p>Enable (1) for COOP like; Disable (0) for SP like.</p>
			<p>In other words, if this code is enabled, any code below that is enabled will be COOP like; if the code is disabled, any code below that is enabled will be SP like.</p>
			<h4>- Pickup effects</h4>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/diff/pickup_effects.png" alt="Pickup Effects particles Differences">
			<h4>- Ricochet bullets</h4>
			<p>Normally, in Single Player, Ricochet bullets get spawned but in COOP, they are replaced by 9mm. Don't know what's the reason for it but I guess the balancing? or performance because Ricochet tends to bounce around? Who knows. The effect can be easly seen on "The Tower of Confusion" after the very first fight.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/diff/bullets.png" alt="Ricochet bullets getting replaced by 9mm in COOP">
			<h4>- Get Medals</h4>
			<p>Get medals in COOP... or if Fake Byte is enabled, it will be disabled for both SP and COOP. When medal is awarded in COOP, it applies to both player profiles.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Remove letterbox on cutscenes</h4>
			<p>Removes black bars on cutscenes.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/no_cutscene_borders.png" alt="Removed black bars on a cutscene">
			<br>
			<h4>Enable female sounds for female models</h4>
			<p>Enables unused female sound set for female models which are: Cheerleader, Vampire and Nesbot.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Make a cool loading screen</h4>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/cool_loading.png" alt="Unused Loading screen">
			<h4>Replace SamLogo video with Gotham games</h4>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/gotham_games.gif" alt="Unused Gotham Games video">
			<h4>Replace Main Menu music with Hidden music</h4>
			<p>Replaces the Main Menu music with the unused soundtrack.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Alternative Screen Mode</h4>
			<p>Enables alternative screen mode. Useful for widescreen with horizontal split-screen. Start the Split-Screen game twice to save it to the profile.</p>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/alternative_screenmode.png" alt="Alternative screen mode in SS">
			<h4>Reset to default</h4>
			<p>Resets it back to default. Start the Split-Screen game twice to save it to the profile.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>ONLINE LEVELS IN OFFLINE CODES</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>ATTENTION!</h3>
			<p>If you want to enable the online levels in offline with best experience, use all the codes below + <a href="#misc">Enable Online in Offline</a>.</p>
			<p>After enabling, go into: Online, Host New Game; and open each gamemode for the code to apply for each gamemode. After that, choose "MultiPlayer" menu and enjoy.</p>
			<p><b>If "LevelSet" has been saved to the Memory Card, then only the "OPTIONAL" codes are needed.</b></p>
			<img src="../../img/SSNE/addons/online_levels.png" alt="Online levels in SS">
			<br>
			<h4>Enable Online levels in Offline</h4>
			<p>Enables the online-only levels into offline. Saves the "3" into "LevelSet" when each gamemode opens (except COOP). When autosave activates, the "LevelSet" is saved onto the memory card. This code breaks the showing of level names/icons (in Offline level stuff only).</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Load Offline LevelSet in Online</h4>
			<p>Loads Level stuff from offline into online.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>OPTIONAL! Fix for correctly showing Online levels in Offline</h3>
			<h4>Change levels for Offline mode</h4>
			<p>Changes level for offline mode instead of online.</p>
			<h4>Load Online LevelSet instead of Offline</h4>
			<p>Loads level stuff from online instead of offline. This corrects the loading of level icons.</p>
			<h4>Alternative</h4>
			<p>Alternative version if the above doesn't work but this one breaks the COOP icon when COOP mode is selected.</p>

		<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
		<h2>Random codes with random effects.</h2>
			<h4>Enable Online in Offline</h4>
			<p>Enables Online menu to work in offline. Useful for modding.</p>
			<h4>Bypass connecting errors</h4>
			<p>Bypasses the errors when trying to find the games or host. But the game still cannot be hosted so this can be used to show the online menus.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Seriously Silly Weapon Set</h4>
			<p>Enables cut weapon set that was used in Gamecube version of the game called "Seriously Silly".</p>

			<img src="../../img/SSNE/misc/giant_hornet.png" alt="Giant Hornet">
			<br>
			<h4>Stop auto-killing entities</h4>
			<p>Disables the function that auto-kills enemies for bunch of reasons. Many Wickerman dies because of this.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Giant Hornet replaces Witch Harpy</h4>
