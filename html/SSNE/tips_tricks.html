		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<p>- No need to kill all the enemies if wanting to get the door open. This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR SPEEDRUNNERS!</p>
			<p>- Anything else that applies for classics applies for this one aswell.</p>
			<p>- Setting Friendly Fire option in COOP to OFF or REVERSE nerfs any enemy fire attack that deals massive damage to the player.</p>
			<p>- If a player respawns on a level with a vehicle (jeep), the vehicle also respawns with full health and can be found in it's original position.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Tricks</h3>
			<h4>Switching weapons trick</h4>
			<p>Switching the weapon while it's reloading skips the reload animation. When switched back, it comes back to the idle stance.</p>
			<p>This is extremly useful for Sniper Rifle which is one of the most powerful weapons.</p>
			<h4>How to do it?</h4>
			<p>Simply while the weapon is going to reload, switch to another weapon and then switch back.</p>
			<p>This also works for Double-Barrel Shotgun and Serious Bomb but the timing has to be right.</p>
			<p>For other, switch as fast as you can. It works on: Grenade Launcher, Sniper Rifle and Cannon.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Checkpoint trick</h4>
			<p>Some checkpoints get triggered before the fight is over. This makes it useful for speedrunning.</p>
			<h4>How to do it?</h4>
			<p>For example, on Via Aurelia, there is a position where early checkpoint can be triggered. It's in front of the barn with Juvenile Werebulls, in the middle where usually 3 items spawn ( 2 HP and 1 ARMOR ).</p>
			<p>After triggering the checkpoint and respawning to it will skip all the fights before like they were finished.</p>
